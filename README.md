## Project Descriptions

### 1. Life Expectancy Prediction
**Notebook:** `life-expectancy-prediction.ipynb`  
This project explores a dataset related to global life expectancy. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate life expectancy based on various health and socio-economic indicators.  
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, regression models.
- **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.

### 2. Linear Regression Basics
**Notebook:** `linear-regression-basics.ipynb`  
A simple notebook focusing on the fundamentals of linear regression. This includes concepts such as:
- **Ordinary Least Squares Regression**: Theory and implementation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, RÂ²
- **Visualization**: Plotting regression lines and residuals

### 3. Netflix Content Clustering
**Notebook:** `netflix-content-clustering.ipynb`  
This project involves clustering Netflix titles based on various features such as genre, release year, and other metadata. It demonstrates:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical features
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA or other techniques for visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**
- Familiarity with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hanyG175/machine-learning.git
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate on Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Activate on macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you can install libraries individually (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.)*

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open the Desired Notebook**  
   In your web browser, navigate to the notebook you want to explore (e.g., `life-expectancy-prediction.ipynb`).

3. **Run the Cells**  
   Execute each cell in order to reproduce the results and experiments.
